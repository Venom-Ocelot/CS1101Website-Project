        <p>This movie is the best thing ever! I made my wife watch it 32 times with me in a marathon I like to call, the Ledger experience. We both went a little crazy, a little insane after watching the movie that many times in a row, akin to Ledger's preparation to his role as The Joker. Oh and Christian Bale was alright in this performance. I guess. </p>
